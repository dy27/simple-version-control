# simple-version-control

A simple version control program which supports init, add, commit, branch, checkout, remove, reset and merge commands.

## Implementation
The filesystem structure used consists of a database of files, commits and branches. The database of files stores a copy of every version of every file, where each file is referenced by a unique hash which is generated by the hashing algorithm based on the file contents. A database of commits stores each commit referenced by its commit ID, and each commit holds references to the files contained in the commit. Each commit references its parent commits, such that all the commits form a directed graph. Each branch references a commit.

## Features
* Hashing algorithm is optimised to rapidly compute hashes of large files.
* Utilises memory-mapped I/O to speed up file reading and writing.
* Implements a custom memory allocator using memory mapping.
